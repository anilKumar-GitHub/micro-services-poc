COURSE UPDATE : Disable XML Format Support
RECOMMENDATION: Disable XML Support

Remove this from pom.xml

<dependency>
	<groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat</groupId>
	<artifactId>jackson-dataformat-xml</artifactId>
</dependency>


WHY?
PROBLEM: Browsers give preference to XML over JSON (They send Accept header with application/xml). 

However, I prefer seeing responses with JSON in the browser (For most people REST = JSON)
